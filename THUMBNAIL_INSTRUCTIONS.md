# Thumbnail Management Instructions

## Overview
This jukebox application has been enhanced to use local thumbnails for faster loading and offline use.

## Setup Steps
1. Run the thumbnail downloader to fetch all thumbnails:
   ```
   node thumbDownloader.js
   ```

2. The thumbnails will be downloaded to: /Users/mikeclarkin/Thumbnails

3. The script.js file has been patched to prioritize local thumbnails over remote ones.

## Notes
- If a thumbnail is not found locally, the application will still try to load it from the internet
- You can re-run the thumbnail downloader at any time to fetch new thumbnails
- The thumbnail downloader requires Node.js

## Benefits
- Faster initial loading
- Reduced internet usage
- Works better in low-connectivity environments
- Reduces API rate limiting issues with YouTube
